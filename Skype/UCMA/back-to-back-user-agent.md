# Back-to-back user agent

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 provides several classes to support the back-to-back user agent concept. The principal class of interest to application developers is the [BackToBackCall](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.rtc.collaboration.backtobackcall?view=ucma-api) class. 

Using back-to-back user agent functionality, an application can perform the following operations:

- Create a **BackToBackCall** instance, which establishes back-to-back connectivity between two calls. For example, a customer and an agent are connected through a back-end call center.

- Perform midway call control (transfer calls, park calls, play music to customers on hold) on an established back-to-back call.

This section includes the following topics:

- [Call leg scenarios](call-leg-scenarios.md)
- [Back-to-back user agent architecture](back-to-back-user-agent-architecture.md)
