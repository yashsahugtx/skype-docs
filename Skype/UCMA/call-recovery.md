# Call recovery

**Applies to**: Skype for Business 2015

Recovery mechanisms in Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) provide for call recovery in the event of server failure, with minimal application impact. The intent is to restore and maintain SIP path connectivity whenever possible, without requiring any user or application intervention. In nearly all cases, the application is unaware of resiliency activity, but in advanced scenarios, or for UI-driven applications, it can be useful to be aware of this activity.
