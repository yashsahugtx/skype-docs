# VoiceXML support in UCMA 5.0


_**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API 5.0 supports Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications authored with the industry-standard VoiceXML markup language. You can now create .NET applications that host a local or remote VoiceXML-based IVR application in UCMA 5.0. You can also migrate existing VoiceXML applications to UCMA 5.0 that may have been running on other platforms.

A hosting .NET application authored in UCMA 5.0 can process the markup language in VoiceXML applications. UCMA 5.0 gives VoiceXML applications access to telephony and audio functionality that facilitates automated communication with callers.
